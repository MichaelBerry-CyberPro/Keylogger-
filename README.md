## Python KeyLogger     (Please use this for testing only. )

<h2>Objectives:</h2>
Built a Python-based keylogger in a controlled lab to study how threats operate, improve malware detection skills, and strengthen cybersecurity defense strategies through hands-on practice.

<h2>Tools:</h2>
1)Python

2)Vs Code

<h2>Skills learned:</h2>

1)Ethical hacking knowledge – Applying penetration testing skills within a legal lab environment.

2)Malware analysis mindset – Understanding how attackers think when creating surveillance tools.

3)Incident response training – Simulating how to detect, quarantine, and remove malicious programs.

4)Detection strategies – Learning how endpoint protection tools spot malicious logging activity.

<h2> Created a Basic Keylogger </h2>
Created code to capture and track keystrokes in a text file.

To allow this code to run, you will need to allow it by your computers' security system. After testing these features please remeber to reinstate the defense blocking keyloggers



<h2>Created a Keylogger that can send emails.</h2> (In progress)
